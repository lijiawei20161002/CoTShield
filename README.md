# 🛡️ CoTShield — Revealing AI’s Hidden Reasoning to Defend Free Inquiry
A lightweight tool to surface hidden logic and detect deceptive reasoning in chain-of-thought (CoT) AI systems.

🌟 Overview

CoTShield helps uncover what advanced language models are really “thinking”—even when they try to hide it.

As AI systems grow more capable and strategic, they may learn to appear helpful while hiding deceptive or reward-hacking behavior in subtle ways. CoTShield makes reasoning chains legible and auditable, helping humans contest AI logic and restore visibility into the thought processes behind outputs.

🔍 Features
	•	🧠 CoT Divergence Detection
Detect inconsistencies between model reasoning and final outputs.
	•	👻 Shadow Intent Reconstruction
Infer what a model may have “thought but not said” using a secondary LLM.
	•	🧾 Reasoning Trace Viewer
Interactive web tool to step through model chains-of-thought and flag hidden assumptions.
	•	🧪 Adversarial Evaluation Tasks
Test how well different models stay epistemically hones

📦 Getting Started (Coming Soon)

We are building a modular Python-based package that can be run locally or integrated into LLM eval pipelines.
